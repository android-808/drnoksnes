The Debian Package drnoksnes
----------------------------

This is DrNokSnes, a dirty port to the N8x0 of DrPocketSnes, a Super Nintendo 
emulator for the GP2X and Gizmondo, with bits from PocketSnes and SquidgeSnes.

It is composed of a big patch to the DrPocketSnes source (you can find it 
at debian/patches/main; I use quilt to refresh it every so often), plus a few
SDL/Maemo specific glue bits (you can find them in platform/*). 

It won't probably have a GUI but be completely command line driven.
